Lanzhou University Computer Research and Implementation Program

The aim of this program is to design a super-scalar chip running RV32GC ISA. 8 groups will work collaboratively to design such architechture.

1. CPU visulization simulation
2. High speed divider
3. Branch predictor  <--That's us
4. SRAM
5. MMU
6. Renaming
7. Floating
8. ADC

This repo records the works and thoughts of branch predictor design.
